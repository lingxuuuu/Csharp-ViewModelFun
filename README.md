# ViewModel Fun
his project should have 4 routes that each display a different model from our controller. We'll start out with a few simple built-in types (strings and ints), and then use a custom class (User) to display a single User and a collection of Users.

You will need to create a User class (just FirstName and LastName string fields will be sufficient). Eventually, this data will come from somewhere more meaningful (like your database), but for now just initialize the required object directly in your controller.
